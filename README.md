aes67-SAP

Conceptually a AES67 audio mixer for the Pi3 with the RT kernel patches.

Status: the code is very experimental, should be able to do loopback testing with a compatible AES67 device (tested with a Yamaha Rio).

use with aes67-pi3-buildroot repo and add output/host/bin to your path before running the makefile.
